# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  
For the first analysis, I began by creating a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. I also used the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. Then, used the COUNT function to create a table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title. Finally, I filtered to include only current employees in my analysis, to be sure to exclude those employees who have already left the company.
For the second analysis, I created a table for mentorship-eligibility that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
